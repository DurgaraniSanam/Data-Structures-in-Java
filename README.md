# 📚 Data Structures in Java

Welcome to the **Data Structures in Java** repository!  
This project demonstrates the implementation and usage of fundamental data structures using Java.

## 🧠 What You'll Find in This Repository

This repository covers:

### 🔗 Linked Lists
- **Singly Linked List** – Basic operations like insertion, deletion, traversal.
- **Doubly Linked List** – Forward and backward traversal.
- **Circular Linked List** – Continuous looped lists with tail pointing to head.

### 📦 Stacks
- Implemented using:
  - Arrays
  - Linked Lists
- Common operations like `push()`, `pop()`, and `peek()`.

### 📋 Queues
- Types:
  - **Simple Queue**
  - **Circular Queue**
  - **Priority Queue**
- Implemented using:
  - Arrays
  - Linked Lists

### 🔢 Sets
- **HashSet** – Uses hashing for quick insertion and lookup.
- **TreeSet** – Sorted set implemented using Red-Black Tree.

### 🗺️ Maps
- **HashMap** – Stores key-value pairs using hashing for fast access.
- **TreeMap** – Maintains keys in sorted order using a Red-Black Tree.
